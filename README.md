# Projects

These are all the projects I've worked on both individually and in groups.


**Python Programming**
1. Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Car Rental Program (Object-Oriented-Programming)


For Tic-Tac-Toe, it's simple. 
Player is given 'X' and program will prompt for position (1 to 9) where He/She wants to place the 'X'.

Computer will then randomly generate a position to place 'O'.

If player inputs an invalid input - Position is occupied or not number 1 to 9, program will prompt for input again.
