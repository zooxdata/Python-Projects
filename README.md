# Python Projects

These are all the projects I've worked on both individually and in groups.


**Python Programming**
1. Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Car Rental Program (Object-Oriented-Programming)


For Tic-Tac-Toe, it's simple. 
Player is given 'X' and program will prompt for position (1 to 9) where He/She wants to place the 'X'\
![Input Position](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88434211/135615183-67b5406d-a1f7-4dca-92f3-6c4d769663af.png)\
Computer will then randomly generate a position to place 'O'\
![Computer Played Its turn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88434211/135615182-040025ed-992c-4ed0-9b90-522ebaa90680.png)\
If player inputs an invalid input - Position is occupied or not number 1 to 9, program will prompt for input again\
![Wrong Input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88434211/135615179-a54f497c-d8e1-465d-bc03-12ff3c225a9d.png)\
![Not Number Input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88434211/135615175-37866ad0-520c-4ab8-b96d-7697c1982f7b.png)\
The game is then played until someone wins the game\
![Won The Game](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88434211/135615178-2e5531c4-a248-4883-9170-a70779a39f34.png)  


For the Car Rental Project, we were tasked to code a program that features:
- View Available Inventory
- View Rental Costs
- Rental Calculator
- Make A Reservation
- Cancel A Reservation

I've attempted to do them both via Object-Oriented Programming Way and the simple and direct way of using CSV Files and manipulating it via inputs from Users (Pseudo-DB)
